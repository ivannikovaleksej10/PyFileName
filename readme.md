# PyFileName
This program renames all files in the specified directory into an ordered list from zero to infinity, keeping the original extension

## Who needs this program?
Anyone who is somehow connected with working on a computer, and especially if you have to constantly deal with a bunch of files with ugly names

## Future plans
- Make it possible to choose a name format
- Make it possible to choose where to save renamed files while keeping the originals in their places
- Draw icon
- Create a website with detailed information about the project
- *(Maybe)* Rework code and design
